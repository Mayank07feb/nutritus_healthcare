        Welcome To Nutritus Healthcare Pvt. Ltd.
      </h2>

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Nutritus Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. entered the healthcare nutrition market with a mission:
        to provide high-quality, scientifically designed nutrition products at affordable prices
        for all individuals.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Recognizing the importance of proper nutrition for infants, we introduced an advanced
        infant formula with a nutritional profile close to breast milk. While breast milk remains
        the best, certain medical conditions may require formula feeding—and our products
        offer a trusted, safe, and scientifically backed alternative.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Our infant formula range is time-tested, quality-assured, and designed to support
        various age groups and developmental stages. We ensure every product meets the highest
        standards of safety, nutrition, and affordability.
